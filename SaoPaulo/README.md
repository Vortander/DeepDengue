## São Paulo DeepDengue models

Dengue estimation deep learning models using aerial and street-level images from São Paulo city, Brazil.

### Aerial-only models

* *SpSat19*, zoom level = 19: [**SpSat19**](https://docs.ufpel.edu.br/index.php/s/plM7SE4Tuonrts6)

### Street-only models

* *SpStreet* trained using Google Street View images, with transfer learning from *RioStreet* model: [**SpStreet**](https://docs.ufpel.edu.br/index.php/s/R8twvJMFy4hpCox)

### Aerial and Street-level combined models

* *SpStreetSat19*, street-level and aerial images (zoom = 19): [**SpStreetSat19**](https://docs.ufpel.edu.br/index.php/s/4eY1G3av3mTKUQu)
