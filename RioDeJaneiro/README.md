## Rio de Janeiro DeepDengue models

Dengue estimation deep learning models using aerial and street-level images from Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil.

### Aerial-only models

* *RioSat19*, zoom level = 19: [**RioSat19**](https://docs.ufpel.edu.br/index.php/s/PG1Kz7x7OddNs8S)
* *RioSat20*, zoom level = 20: [**RioSat20**](https://docs.ufpel.edu.br/index.php/s/oUPyI1hFT9OAGne)
* *RioSat21*, zoom level = 21 (published in IJCNN-2019): [**RioSat21**](https://docs.ufpel.edu.br/index.php/s/mv3BAHO3dLqgRkQ)

### Street-only models

* *RioStreet* trained using Google Street View images: (published in IJCNN-2019): [**RioStreet**](https://docs.ufpel.edu.br/index.php/s/CT47tcvKiJsMn5y)

### Aerial and Street-level combined models

* *RioStreetSat*, street-level and aerial images (zoom = 19): [**RioStreetSat19**](https://docs.ufpel.edu.br/index.php/s/5CpqZwwAPdHJnIQ)
* *RioStreetSat*, street-level and aerial images (zoom = 21) (published in IJCNN-2019): [**RioStreetSat21**](https://docs.ufpel.edu.br/index.php/s/9AdzHzWyzoHyjOc)
