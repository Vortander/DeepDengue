# DeepDengue

DeepDengue is a collection of deep learning models trained for the estimation of dengue fever cases in geographic locations, using only street-level and aerial images as input.
This work was developed during my Doctorate degree in Computer Science, at Federal University of Pelotas ([UFPel](http://portal.ufpel.edu.br/)).
The full-text of my Thesis is available at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340488901).
